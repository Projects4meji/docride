            <strong>AI Chatbot Integration:</strong> DocRide incorporates
            advanced chatbot integrations from reputable providers to enable
            users to develop Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) management
            systems efficiently and effectively. However, artificial
            intelligence (AI) tools, including these chatbots, may produce
            errors, omissions, or incomplete outputs. It is the sole
            responsibility of the user to thoroughly review and verify all AI-
            generated content, including documents, recommendations, or data,
            prior to submission for approval or implementation. LeadQual UK Ltd.
            is not liable for any consequences arising from reliance on
            unverified AI-produced work.
